## :dart: About ##

**AME (Collection of School Supplies)** is a project developed during the Hackathon of [training program](https://digital.fcamara.com.br/programadeformacao) 2021 of Grupo [FCamara](https://www.fcamara.com.br/).

**The challenge was problematic:**

> "We know how complicated it is for parents
to be able to buy school supplies for their children.
Prices increase from semester to semester.
Especially when we talk about education
public, where the difficulty is even greater and comes
several factors ... "


**And as a proposal:**

> Thinking about it, we had the idea to create a
application, where parents will register their
children who study at state schools and
municipalities, and also the list of materials
who needs and cannot afford
buying.
Individuals and anonymous users can
access, search for school based on
some search criteria, view the
Need of needy students and make the
donation of the items that a particular
student studying in need. Let's help ?!

Based on this proposal, the AME develops. An application where school parents register their students and their school supplies needs. From that, donors will have the possibility to research the schools participating in the AME and see the children who need help.

Schools have a fundamental role to play in this process. For they will be the intermediaries between donors and children.
